# Advent of AI

**Advent of AI** is an advent-calendar–style series of AI engineering challenges designed to teach you how to build real-world AI agent applications. Each weekday from **December 1st to December 23rd**, a new challenge is unlocked, helping you practice everything from CI automation to multi-agent orchestration — all while learning **goose**, an AI-agent development framework.

## 🎄 What Is Advent of AI?

Advent of AI is a hands-on learning experience where you build a new AI-powered project every day. Each challenge is intentionally scoped as a small but complete project, helping you gradually master agent engineering concepts while building a real portfolio of AI tools.

You’ll create automations, CLIs, UIs, multi-agent systems, and more — with daily videos and resources to guide you.

---

## 📅 How It Works

- **17 challenges total** (one per weekday from Dec 1–23)
- **New challenge unlocks at 12 PM ET**
- Each project teaches real AI engineering concepts using **goose**
- Solution walkthrough videos release the next morning
- Challenges include creative builds (fortune generators), production tasks (CI automation), and advanced systems (multi-agent councils)

---

## 🎯 Who Is It For?

Advent of AI is designed for:

- **Beginners** who want a guided path into AI agent development
- **Intermediate developers** who want practical AI engineering experience
- **Advanced builders** exploring automation, orchestration, and system-level AI design
- Anyone looking to build **portfolio-ready AI projects**

Each challenge includes optional “bonus objectives” for deeper exploration.
