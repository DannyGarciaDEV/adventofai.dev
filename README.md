# Madame Zelda's Winter Fortune Generator 🔮

## What is Advent of AI?
Advent of AI is a coding challenge calendar that helps developers learn to build with AI agents. Each day brings a new project focused on practical AI engineering - from CI automation to multi-agent orchestration. The challenges are designed to teach developers how to work with goose and build real-world AI applications.

Think of it as an advent calendar, but instead of chocolates, you get exciting AI engineering challenges that help you master building with AI agents!
